# object-detection
A computer vision project focused on detecting objects in images using deep learning techniques. This implementation utilizes pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or Haar Cascades to identify and locate objects within various types of images. The project demonstrates how to load models, process input data, and visualize detection results using bounding boxes.
